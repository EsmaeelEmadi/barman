While I acknowledge the importance of visually appealing design, this project overview primarily focuses on reviewing the architecture of React/Next.js. As such, I won't be dedicating attention to design elements in this context.
However, it's worth noting that I bring three years of experience working as a graphic designer. I am proficient in creating website designs, familiar with tools such as Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop. Despite the emphasis on architecture in this review, my design skills complement my overall capabilities.
In this preview, my focus lies on assessing the project structure, tooling, and other relevant aspects essential for React/Next.js development.
