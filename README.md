# Test Project

## NOTES

**importatnt**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>I tried to use `mockapi.io` as a mock server but I had lots of issues, it sends back wrong response on requests and on posting new data it creates a random resource 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>While I acknowledge the importance of visually appealing design, this project overview primarily focuses on reviewing the architecture of React/Next.js. As such, I won't be dedicating attention to design elements in this context.
>However, it's worth noting that I bring three years of experience working as a graphic designer. I am proficient in creating website designs, familiar with tools such as Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop. Despite the emphasis on architecture in this review, my design skills complement my overall capabilities.
>In this preview, my focus lies on assessing the project structure, tooling, and other relevant aspects essential for React/Next.js development.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>I want to address the task concerning the usability of selecting product variants. Frankly, I misunderstood the requirements initially. The task was to "Develop an Options Selector component for choosing product variants. Ensure that the component updates the product details dynamically."
>I didn't implement this feature because I generate product details and pages using ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), which I believe is the appropriate approach for this scenario.
